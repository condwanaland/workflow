# workflow

workflow is a new R package I am working based on some ideas I have had for contructing reproducible workflows. I intend to work on it where I have bits and pieces of space time.

The goal of workflow is to provide a consise, abstracted, and powerful platform to run an R analysis as a fully reproducible project.

workflow takes a lot if inspiration from other, similarily themed, packages such as "ProjectTemplate", "rrtools", and "workflowr". However, workflows goal is to take a more simple approach for people not interested in having their analysis as a package or a website, but rather are just looking for a way to structure their analysis in a reproducible manner. 

## Installation

You can install workflow from github with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("condwanaland/workflow")
```

## Example

To see a full example of how to set up, and run a project with workflow, please read the included vignette.
